# Digital Pheno-Parenting: A Deep Learning Model for Plant Phenotypes and Care

## üìå Project Overview
Digital Pheno-Parenting is an advanced deep learning framework designed to identify plant species and detect leaf diseases from RGB images. It integrates three pretrained convolutional neural networks into an ensemble architecture, LeafNet, to achieve high classification accuracy. In addition to disease prediction, the system provides automated plant care recommendations. The solution is deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## üåø Objectives
- Accurately classify plant species and associated leaf diseases.
- Leverage model ensembling (ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet) for improved performance.
- Offer actionable plant care suggestions based on the classification.
- Deploy an accessible interface for real-time predictions.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset comprises approximately 87,000 labeled RGB images representing 12 plant species and 38 disease/healthy classes. It is split 80% for training and 20% for testing, with balanced class distribution to ensure model fairness.

## üß† Model Architecture
LeafNet combines the feature extractors of ResNet18, EfficientNet-B7, and MobileNet V3-Large. Their outputs are concatenated and passed through a shared fully connected layer for final classification. All base models are fine-tuned, and redundant heads are removed to streamline the ensemble.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training Details
- **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Scheduler:** ReduceLROnPlateau  
- **Regularization:** Batch Normalization, Dropout, Early Stopping  

## üìä Results
- **ResNet Accuracy:** 98.63%  
- **EfficientNet Accuracy:** 93.92%  
- **MobileNet Accuracy:** 98.05%  
- **LeafNet Final Accuracy:** 99.29%  

## üß© Care Suggestion Module
Upon disease classification, the system provides concise, species-specific care guidance‚Äîcovering watering frequency, fertilizer recommendations, and pest management‚Äîto assist farmers and plant owners.

## üöÄ Deployment
The model is deployed via Streamlit, offering:
- An upload portal for leaf images  
- Real-time disease prediction  
- Integrated care suggestions based on diagnosis  

## üîß Technologies Used
- Python 3.11  
- PyTorch, Torchvision  
- Scikit-learn, Pandas  
- OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- Streamlit
